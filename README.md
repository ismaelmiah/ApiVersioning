Simple Project About Api-Versioning in Asp .Net Core 3.1

> API versioning in ASP.NET Core is a technique by which different clients can get different implementations of the same Controller based on the request or the URL.So essentially, you build an API that has multiple versions that may behave differently.



**There are multiple ways to achieve API versioning in ASP.NET Core Applications. The commonly used approaches to version a WebApi are as follows**

1. URL based.
2. Query String based.
3. HTTP Header based.
